# Managing Concurrent Updates
Hi!
Recently, I was asked how to manage transactions against databases in this multithread world.

So, I have spent my time in the last week studying some solutions.
I start, understanding about Optimistic Locking and Pessimistic Locking. Here is a great article to do that: https://www.baeldung.com/jpa-pessimistic-locking

### Tech
I used a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [SpringBoot]
* [JUnit]
* [H2]
* [Hibernate]

### Running

Run the IntegrationTest!
Run the IntegrationEtagsTest!

**Enjoy it!**
